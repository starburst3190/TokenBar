#!/bin/bash
# Build Sparkle.framework with installed-application-name normalization enabled.
#
#   scripts/build-sparkle.sh        # builds if needed, prints the framework path
#
# Why this exists: SPARKLE_NORMALIZE_INSTALLED_APPLICATION_NAME is a
# compile-time macro (Sparkle's Configurations/ConfigCommon.xcconfig sets it to
# 0), not an Info.plist key, so the official prebuilt xcframework can never
# perform the v2.0 TokenBar.app -> Syrtis.app rename no matter what the app
# declares. Enabling it requires compiling Sparkle ourselves. OpenAI did the
# same for the Codex -> ChatGPT rename.
#
# The macro has three consumers, all inside the framework, so one rebuild
# covers them: SUInstaller.m (chooses the install path), SUPlainInstaller.m
# (switches away from the atomic swap when the path changes) and
# InstallerProgressAppController.m (relaunches the app at the new path).
#
# Source comes from SwiftPM's own checkout, which Package.resolved already pins.
# Cloning Sparkle separately would create a second revision to keep in sync with
# the one the app links against.
#
# The macro is not exposed in any of the framework's 23 public headers, so the
# app still compiles and links against the stock SPM artifact; only the binary
# copied into Contents/Frameworks changes. Package.swift is untouched.
