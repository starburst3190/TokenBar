        //     the time range already separates them. All four live series

        //   * Both attempts at a guard broke working cards. Comparing against
        //     the parsed `resetsAt` fails because the engine quantises
        //     `resetAt` to the minute (codex differed by 62s, grok by 19s);

        //     the cycle these points belong to. Each version silently filtered
        //     every sample and the card fell to "no quota history".
        //

        // ever appears, the fix belongs where the cycle is known: the engine.
