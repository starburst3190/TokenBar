/// mounted by a `.task` that dies with the popover, so every reopen starts the
/// loop again and issues the leading call immediately. Opening and closing the
/// popover ten times issues ten requests, with nothing in between them.
///
/// That is enough to reach Anthropic's rate limit on `oauth/usage`. The engine
/// has a gate for the aftermath — a 429 blocks further attempts until the

///

/// never skipped, long enough that reopening cannot outpace it. The five-minute
/// tray refresh is unaffected. One consequence worth knowing: a payload
/// carrying the gate's own "retrying in ~Ns" message is cached like any other,
/// so that countdown can read up to 50s stale.

/// claimed. Swift actors are reentrant across `await`: while the first caller
/// is suspended inside the fetch, the actor is free to admit the second, which
/// finds the cache still empty and starts its own request. Three callers
/// arriving together would issue three — the burst this exists to prevent,
/// surviving inside the thing built to prevent it. Holding the `Task` and
