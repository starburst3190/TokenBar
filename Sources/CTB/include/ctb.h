// C-ABI surface of crates/tb_core_ffi. Every function returns a heap-allocated
// NUL-terminated JSON string that must be released with tb_free.
//
// Envelope: every entry point except tb_probe returns
//   {"ok":true,"data":<payload>}   on success
//   {"ok":false,"err":"..."}       on failure
// Payload fields use the Tauri frontend's camelCase contract. In particular,
// AgentUsagePayload is `{generatedAt, publicationGeneration?, agents,
// opencodeSubscriptions}` (the subscription array is omitted when empty).
// `publicationGeneration` is an additive optional Rust `u64` JSON integer for
// generated payloads; demo/legacy payloads omit it.
// Rust assigns it with a checked increment at process-wide publication-gate
// entry before the complete provider run; exhaustion returns an outer error
// rather than repeating a generation. The gate orders generations and pointer
// creation, but is released before `tb_agent_usage` returns and therefore does
// not promise C return order. Swift's shared MainActor publication coordinator
// rejects a lower generation for dashboard, Settings, tray, and snapshot
// consumers. AgentUsage snapshots may additionally carry the additive optional
// camelCase field
// `transportDiagnostic?: {category, status?, osCode?}`. `error` remains the
// user-visible provider status and may coexist with last-good windows;
// `transportDiagnostic` is the only provider failure detail permitted in the
// public Unified Log. Its `category` is limited to timeout/dns/tls/
// connectionRefused/connectionReset/connect/request/responseBody/rateLimited/
// serverError. `rateLimited` accepts only status 429; `serverError` accepts only
// 500...599. HTTP categories do not carry `osCode`; non-HTTP categories do not
// carry `status`. `osCode`, when present, is a 32-bit OS error integer. Neither
// field carries token, header,
// body, URL/query, email, account ID, credential path, or free-form cause data.
// Other report payloads retain their existing camelCase shapes from the Tauri
// contract. Adding these fields does not change C function signatures, ownership,
// ABI, or any other wire fields. Each v3 quota window uses
// `{cardId, label, usedPercent, remainingPercent, resetsAt, resetText,
// windowMinutes, paceStatus, historicalPace}`. `paceStatus` is required and
// carries `{state, windowKey, durationSeconds, durationSource, completeCycles,
// reason}`; positive durationSeconds is the pace calculation source of truth,
// while windowMinutes is compatibility output derived by integer division.
// historicalPace is present only for `available` and carries one coherent Rust
// result: `{expectedUsedPercent, etaSeconds, willLastToReset,
// runOutProbability}`. A legacy payload missing the entire paceStatus key is
// not eligible for an implicit Linear fallback. ETA/risk remain optional inside
// an available historical result. Other report payloads retain their existing
// camelCase shapes from the Tauri contract.
// tb_probe keeps its Phase 0 shape: {"ok":true,"messages":N} / {"ok":false,...}.

 * ends would buy precision nobody reads at the cost of a 0% hit rate.
 *
 * `account_key` selects whose transcripts are read: NULL for the primary
 * account, an extra Claude account's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` otherwise — the same
 * value `tb_quota_curve` takes, so a window's usage and the quota it is
 * divided against are scoped by one string. There is no "every account"
 * argument: a quota window belongs to an account, and a total spanning
 * accounts has no quota reading to divide by. Claude accounts only: a
 * captured Antigravity account's key names no config directory, and the app
 * does not pass it. */
