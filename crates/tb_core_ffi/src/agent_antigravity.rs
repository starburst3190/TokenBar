//! Antigravity (Google Code Assist) usage/quota — ported from codexbar's
//! Antigravity provider. Antigravity 2.0 (the IDE and the `antigravity-cli`
//! that replaced `gemini-cli`) does NOT persist per-message token counts
//! locally, so a contribution-graph style breakdown isn't derivable; the quota
//! API is the only usable signal. We mirror codexbar's `auto` source:
//!
//! 1. **Local IDE API (`cli`)** — when Antigravity is running, find its
//!    `language_server` process (carrying a `--csrf_token`), discover its
//!    listening ports with platform-native process tools, and call the local
//!    Connect-RPC `GetUserStatus` over loopback TLS. Live, no token refresh,
//!    no disk writes.
//! 2. **OAuth remote (`oauth`)** — otherwise read the shared Google creds under
//!    `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` (falling back to `~/.gemini`), refresh against Google
//!    (client id/secret scanned from the installed Antigravity.app binary, with
//!    the `agy` CLI as a fallback when the IDE is not installed), and
//!    hit the `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` Code Assist quota endpoints.
//!
//! Both yield per-model "remaining fraction + reset" which map to `UsageWindow`s.

// ── Captured accounts (extra Google accounts copied from agy's login) ─────────
//
// A captured account is a second Google login the user signed `agy` into once
// and asked Syrtis to keep. Capture copies that login's refresh token, plus the
// OAuth client that issued it, into a login-keychain item Syrtis owns; every
// later poll refreshes from that item and calls the same Code Assist quota
// methods as the primary remote route.
//
// It deliberately does not reuse the primary's file-bound refresh path
// (`refresh_access_token_with`): that path exists to share a credential with an
// external writer, and this item has exactly one writer, Syrtis. So there is no
// refresh lock, no lineage binding and no compare-and-swap.
//
// What crosses each boundary:
// - agy's own item (`gemini` / `antigravity`) is read through
//   `/usr/bin/security -w` when the user presses Capture, or once per login
//   change while automatic capture is on (`auto_capture_with`), and never
//   written. The poll path reads only its attributes (`login_marker_with`).
// - Syrtis's item (`CAPTURED_SERVICE`, account = key) is written through a
//   `/usr/bin/security -i` child that receives the command on stdin, so the
//   secret is never on an argv; reads use `-w` and print only to our pipe.
// - The raw Google `sub` never leaves `capture_with` / `auto_capture_with`.
//   Everything downstream —
//   the keychain account, the registry, the FFI `accountKey`, the account and
//   history scopes — uses `captured_key(sub)`.
// - Every error leaving this section is a fixed code or a literal string: no
//   token, sub, key, email, `security` stderr, serde text or Google
//   `error_description`.
