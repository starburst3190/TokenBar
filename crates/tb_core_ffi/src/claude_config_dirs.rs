//! Process-wide registry of the extra Claude config directories the user has
//! configured (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`-isolated accounts). Written by
//! `tb_set_claude_config_dirs`, read by the Claude quota fetch.
//!
//! **Not the same value as `extra_scan_paths`, on purpose.** That registry
//! holds the expanded `<dir>/projects` and `<dir>/transcripts` sub-roots and
//! answers "which directories does the scanner walk". This one holds the
//! config directories themselves and answers "whose credential is this quota
//! card fetched with" — the directory selects the Keychain item
//! (`claude_keychain_service`) and therefore the durable history identity
//! (`claude_history_scope`). The two share one user input and nothing else:
//! a directory the scanner rejects is still a perfectly valid account, and
//! the registered scan subset is empty until the launch-time apply lands,
//! which is an honest answer for scanning and a wrong one for identity.
//!
//! A `RwLock` static rather than an env var, for the same reason
//! `extra_scan_paths` is one: the process is resident and a Settings edit
//! must take effect without a restart.
