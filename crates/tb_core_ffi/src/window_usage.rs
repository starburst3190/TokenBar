/// so there is no answer to which of two Claude accounts it belonged to;
/// counting it once, for the primary, beats today's counting it for both.
/// An extra account with no registered scan root cannot be answered for, and
/// says so instead of reporting an empty window.
///
/// The two registries are installed by separate FFI calls and
/// `ClaudeExtraRoots.install` deliberately wakes the quota pollers between them
/// — a stalled mount would otherwise hold the cards on the previous account set
/// for the whole filesystem timeout. So a just-added account is briefly present
/// in `claude_config_dirs` and absent from `extra_scan_paths`, and an account
/// whose roots the setter refused outright is in that state permanently.
///
/// Reporting zero rows there would be the same class of mistake this file

/// once true; a zero is confidently wrong.
///
/// Deliberately not fixed by making the two registries atomic. They are two
