## Application release

The release workflow is tag-driven. It validates and bundles the native app, produces the archive and update metadata, creates the GitHub Release, publishes the appcast update, updates the Homebrew cask, and dispatches the install-count refresh. Stable and prerelease behavior is decided from the tag and release workflow, not from a hand-edited README.

| Artifact or action | Source of truth | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Native app bundle | `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `scripts/bundle.sh` | Bundle launches and is ad-hoc signed as expected |
| Sparkle archive/signature | Release workflow and Sparkle tools | EdDSA signature verifies against the published archive |
| GitHub Release body | `release_notes.sh` plus optional override files | Body has accurate changes, links, and contribution credit |
| `appcast.xml` | `scripts/make_appcast.sh` and generated feed | XML parses, old items remain, channel semantics are correct |
| Homebrew cask | Release workflow generator plus tap repository | Version, URL, checksum, and style match the published asset |
| Install count | `update-install-count.yml` | Orphan badge branch contains the current filtered asset count |
| Discord presence artwork | Discord Developer Portal (manual, outside this repo) | Before tagging: the application's asset key matches `DiscordPresence.largeImageKey` exactly, lowercase, and still exists. Asset keys cannot be edited after saving and an unresolved key does not error — the image just disappears — so a rename adds the new key and keeps the old one |
| Discord presence consent | This repo | The opt-in switch and everything the disclosure beside it describes must reach users in the SAME release. The switch has never shipped — v1.12.0 carries the payload builder but no key, no transport and no Settings section — so today every user's first sight of it is with the current disclosure. Shipping an addition to the published surface (the repository button was the first) in a LATER release than the switch would resume publishing for anyone already opted in, under copy they never read. Either ship them together or reset the key |

## Code signing and local secret storage

目前SwiftPM與release bundle都是ad-hoc signed；這能驗證bundle完整性流程，但不提供跨rebuild／update穩定的Developer ID designated requirement。因此provider pace的account-scope installation key不得依賴restrictive Keychain ACL，現行source of truth是hardened Application Support目錄內的exact 32-byte owner-only file（directory `0700`、file `0600`）。既有開發用Keychain item不讀取、不刪除、不更新、不遷移。

若未來release chain採用穩定Developer ID signing，可將「Developer ID-gated account-scope Keychain migration」由parked狀態另立plan。Migration必須先匯入並驗證與file完全相同的32 bytes，成功前file仍是source of truth；不得生成新key，否則既有`accountScope`與quota history會斷代。採用Developer ID本身不自動授權實作、發版或刪除舊storage。

## Sparkle and appcast

The feed is a single multi-item appcast. Stable items are channel-less; prerelease items carry the beta channel. The generator reads the existing feed, preserves prior items and signatures, and keeps a bounded history instead of overwriting the feed with one item.

This matters because a single-item writer can hide a still-valid stable version when a bridge or prerelease item is added. The appcast fix uses Sparkle's `generate_appcast` and keeps the application-side channel toggle as a lazy delegate for a possible future beta lane.

## Sparkle is compiled here, not taken from the prebuilt artifact

`scripts/bundle.sh` embeds a `Sparkle.framework` built by `scripts/build-sparkle.sh` with `SPARKLE_NORMALIZE_INSTALLED_APPLICATION_NAME=1`. The official prebuilt xcframework ships that macro off, and it is a compile-time constant rather than an Info.plist key, so no app-side declaration can turn it on. With it off, Sparkle always installs over the host bundle's existing path — an app can never change its own filename through an update. Enabling it is what allows a future rename of the installed bundle to happen through the updater instead of the app moving itself.

The macro has three consumers, all inside the framework, so one rebuild covers them: choosing the install path, switching away from the atomic swap when that path changes, and relaunching the app at the new path.

Source comes from SwiftPM's own checkout under `.build/checkouts/Sparkle`, which `Package.resolved` already pins. A separate clone would introduce a second revision to keep in sync with the one the app links against. The macro appears in none of the framework's public headers, so the app still compiles and links against the stock SPM artifact and `Package.swift` is unchanged; only the binary copied into `Contents/Frameworks` differs. Building it takes roughly two to three minutes and is skipped when the output already matches the pinned revision.

> **Updater rule：** this is the highest-consequence single point in the release chain. A defective framework breaks updating for the entire installed base at once, and the cask is `auto_updates true`, so `brew upgrade` is not a rescue channel. `scripts/bundle.sh` therefore asserts on the binary it just copied — the bundled `Autoupdate` must reference `SUNormalizedInstallationPath` — and fails the build otherwise. The assertion is on the shipping artifact rather than on source text, and it discriminates: the official prebuilt scores zero under the same check. Do not weaken it into a source scan, and do not make embedding the framework conditional; an app assembled without an updater looks fine and silently never updates again.

CI runs `scripts/bundle.sh` on pushes to `main` through `make selftest-bundled`, so a broken Sparkle build fails there rather than after a tag is pushed. Upgrading Sparkle now means rebuilding it here; the prebuilt artifact cannot simply be consumed again.

## Migration principle

能讓現有使用者無動作生效的遷移路徑優先；需要手動操作的步驟只作為 fallback，且任何自動化都不可越過授權邊界。

## Legacy and beta migration

The shipped native app replaced the archived Tauri app at the stable bundle identity. Stable releases may carry a legacy updater metadata artifact so remaining users can cross the old app boundary. The retired beta bridge cannot install a stable bundle with a different filename and bundle identity through Sparkle; its supported path is the in-app Switch action that installs the stable cask and lets the stable app migrate settings on first launch.

> **Bridge rule：** A bridge update error that says “improperly signed” can be a bundle-selection failure rather than a cryptographic failure. For the retired bridge population, use the in-app Switch path or the documented Homebrew install path; do not promise cross-identity Sparkle installation.

The bridge population is shrinking and the beta cask is not the normal installation path. Do not design new release work around increasing that population.

## Homebrew and install count

The current tap name is intentionally retained until a second app justifies a tap migration. A future migration must move all casks, delete their old copies in the same old-tap commit, retain the old public repository, and provide an app-level migration path because users who rely on Sparkle may not run Homebrew often enough to see a tap warning.

The install-count workflow writes a single JSON file to an orphan branch rather than adding a noisy commit to `main`. Its count filters release assets by installable archive extensions and intentionally excludes update metadata downloads.

## Landing deployment

The landing site is an independent Astro build. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` in `landing/`, supplies the public site URL, uploads `landing/dist`, and deploys through GitHub Pages. App CI ignores landing-only changes; Pages deployment is the runtime gate for site-only changes.

Keep English and `zh-tw` copy aligned, preserve original TokenBar design, and treat the landing page as a presentation consumer of product facts rather than a runtime source.

## Post-release verification

The release notes path has two generated forms and at least three published surfaces: the GitHub Release body, the Sparkle appcast description, and the legacy update metadata notes. Generation is non-deterministic, so local preview text is not proof of the CI artifact.

A durable escaping regression occurred when a note first contained literal `<`: awk replacement semantics turned `&lt;` into `<lt;`. Generator changes must use fixtures containing literal `<`, `&`, and `>` and verify the CDATA/HTML round-trip.

| After release | Check |
|---|---|
| GitHub Release | Claims match the actual diff; no previous release fix is re-claimed |
| `appcast.xml` | Description is accurate HTML, item/channel/enclosure/signature are intact |
| Legacy metadata | Notes match the same user-facing change set and signature remains valid |
| Homebrew | Cask points to the new release and checksum matches the asset |
| Landing | Pages build and the deployed route serves the expected locale and assets |
| Update path | Stable app can discover the new stable item; bridge behavior is described honestly |

If wording is wrong, fix the published text without rebuilding the app when possible. Do not treat a release-note correction as permission to create a new release.
